# Description:

This project utilizes a logistic regression model to classify sonar signals as either originating from a rock or a mine.
The dataset used contains features extracted from sonar signals, and the goal is to accurately predict the type of surface detected.
The model is trained and evaluated, achieving a certain accuracy on both training and test datasets (mention the actual accuracies you obtained).
A sample prediction is demonstrated using a provided data point.

# Key Features:

-Data preprocessing and exploration.
-Logistic regression model implementation.
-Model training and evaluation using metrics like accuracy.
-Prediction on new data.

# How to Use:

-Clone the repository.
-Install required libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
-Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and make predictions.
