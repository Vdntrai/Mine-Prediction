# Description:

-This project utilizes a logistic regression model to classify sonar signals as either originating from a rock or a mine.<br/> 
-The dataset used contains features extracted from sonar signals, and the goal is to accurately predict the type of surface detected.<br/> 
-The model is trained and evaluated, achieving a 85% accuracy on training and 71% on testing datasets.<br/> 
-A sample prediction is demonstrated using a provided data point.<br/> 

# Key Features:

-Data preprocessing and exploration.<br/> 
-Logistic regression model implementation.<br/> 
-Model training and evaluation using metrics like accuracy.<br/> 
-Prediction on new data.<br/> 

# How to Use:

-Clone the repository.<br/> 
-Install required libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).<br/> 
-Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and make predictions.<br/>
